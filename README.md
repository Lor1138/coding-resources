## Learning to code is hard.

There is no way about it, learning to code on your own is hard. Thankfully there are a ton of excellent resources out there on the wonderful interwebs. Here are some of my favorites:

- [FreeCodeCamp](www.freecodecamp.com)

- [Scrimba](www.scrimba.com)

- [Code Academy](www.codeacademy.com)

## Community is important

Having a good community of devs has been intregal to my learning consistancy. These are my favorites:

- [Virtual Coffee](www.virtualcoffee.io)
- [Open Sauces](www.opensauced.pizza)
